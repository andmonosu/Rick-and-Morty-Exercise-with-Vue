## Funcionalities implemented:
1. Create a basic store and move some data from your components to the store.
2. Use getters and the state to retrieve the info from the store.
3. Create mutations that modifies the state.
4. Create an action to call the api.
5. Divide the store en two modules, these modules should interact between them. Use `namespaced:true`.
